### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vincent and I'm a Software Development Engineer based in France.

On my personal time, I am currently working on [carentan.vmonot.dev](https://carentan.vmonot.dev): a website to explore the maps from the first Call of Cuty game.\
I document my advances on this project in [my blog](https://vmonot.dev/post/cod-spectator-mode-in-browser-p1/).
